# R: What's in the name?
* Scripting language (vs. compiled language)
* Data Analysis Environment

# Why R?
* Open Source => Free
* Scripting language => rapid prototyping
* The same R-code can run on different OS (MS, MacOs, Linux)
* Most diverse set of statistical tools
* A lot of pre-canned [packages/libraries](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/)
* Large community (and very active development)
* Job "security" (due to its [popularity](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2021))

# From S to R

$\texttt{People are trapped in history and history is trapped in them. (James Baldwin)}$

* **S** programming language: created at Bell Labs (1975-1976). \newline Before, statistical computing was mainly done by calling Fortran routines. 
  * Richard A. Becker
  * *[John M. Chambers](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jmc4/) *
  * Allan R. Wilks
* 1988: ["New S" (aka "Blue Book" by Becker, Chambers & Wilks)](https://www.amazon.com/New-S-Language-R-Becker/dp/0534091938)  introduced a lot of new features:
  * functions (instead of macros)
  * double precision arithmetic
  * interface to Fortan, C[^1]
  * etc.
  * became *similar* to the modern versions of S-PLUS and R.
* 1991: *Statistical Models in S* (Chambers & [Hastie](https://hastie.su.domains/))
  * formula-notation (~ operator)
  * data frames
  * methods and classes (S3)
* 1998: S4 (latest version of S)
  * more advanced object-oriented features ([S4](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html) - quite different from [S3](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S3.html))
    (inheritance & multiple dispatch)
* 1991: [**R**oss Ihaka](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/) and 
        [**R**obert Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician)) (Auckland, New Zealand) 
  * started their own implementation of S and named it ... **R**.
    (*"a free implementation of something 'close to' version 3 of the S language"*)
  * borrowed features from [Scheme](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/) (static/lexical scoping). 
* 1995: R becomes open-source. 
* 2000: Release of R v.1.0.
* 2003: Start of the R Foundation.
* **S** still exists as a commercial product (**S-PLUS**). It is currently owned by TIBCO Software Inc.

# Using R 
  * interactively: **R** CLI or in an IDE. 
  * run as a script containing R code.

# Getting help on R
* Within R itself:
  * $\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{help(cmd)}}$
  * $\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{help(?cmd)}}$
  * $\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{help(??cmd)}}$
  * some keywords require quotes e.g. $\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{?'if'}}$, $\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{?'for'}}$
  
```{R, eval=FALSE}
help(mean)
?mean()
??mean()
?'if'
```

# General statements on R 

* R is **case-sensitive** (cfr. C, C++, Python) => 'a' is different from 'A'.
* Symbol names/variables: alpha-numeric characters are allowed.
  * **MUST** start with a **.** (dot) or a **letter**.
  * if symbol starts with **.** (dot), then second character **MUST** be a letter.
* R commands are separated by:
  * either $\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{;}}$ (semi colon).
  * or newline.
* R commands can be grouped together using $\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{\{\}}}$ (curly braces).   
* R comments: start with $\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{\#}}$ (pound sign) (limited to the same line)
* History: use **arrow up** & **arrow down** to retrieve previous cmds.
  * <font color="blue"><b>.Rhistory</b></font>: contains the recently used R commands
  * <font color="blue"><b>.RData</b></font>: contains the objects stored in the Global Environment

# Exercises: A taste of R
* Start R or RStudio
* Try out the following commands in R.

## Check R's version, system time and Working Directory
```{R, eval=FALSE}
print(R.version.string)
Sys.time()
getwd()
```

## Creation of variables
```{R,eval=FALSE,results='asis'}
x1 <- 5
x1
typeof(x1)
ls()
```

```{R,eval=FALSE}
x2 <- 5L
x2
typeof(x2)
ls()
```

```{R,eval=FALSE}
x3 <- FALSE
x3
typeof(x3)
```

```{R,eval=FALSE}
x4 <- "Programming is cool"
x4
typeof(x4)
```

```{R,eval=FALSE}
x5 <- -15
typeof(x5)
sqrt(x5)
```

```{R,eval=FALSE}
x6 <- -15+0i
typeof(x6)
sqrt(x6)
```

## Tinkering with vectors
```{R,eval=FALSE}
y1 <- 1:5
y1
length(y1)
```

```{R,eval=FALSE}
y2 <- seq(10.,50,by=10)
y2
length(y2)
y2^y1
```

```{R,eval=FALSE}
y3 <- c("Hello", "world", "!")
y3
s <- paste(y3)
s
```

```{R,eval=FALSE}
y4 <- c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)
sum(y4)
```

## Removing objects from your environment
```{R,eval=FALSE}
ls()
rm(c("y1","y2","y3","y4"))
ls()
```

'Function <font color="blue"><b>mode</b></font> gives information about the mode of an object  in the sense of Becker, Chambers & Wilks (1988), and is  more compatible with other implementations of the S language. Finally, the function <font color="blue"><b>storage.mode</b></font> returns the storage mode of its argument in the sense of Becker et al. (1988). It is generally used when calling functions written in another language, such as C or FORTRAN, to ensure that R objects have the data type expected by the routine being called. (In the S language, vectors with integer or real values are both of mode "numeric",
so their storage modes need to be distinguished.)' [R Language Definition, v.4.1.2 (2021-11-01) p. 2](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.pdf)
